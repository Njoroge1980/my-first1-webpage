    <h1>MY FAVORITE PLACES</h1>
      <p>I've been rather fortunate to be able to visit a few places locally and beyond
      during my work. The choice of places below is of course based on these experiences
    with probably one fantasy destination i think i might one day want to visit</p>
    <h2>Bangkok</h2>
      <p>The capital city of Thailand is a hot and humid concrete jungle. I find
        it beautiful, but likely because i seem to have had idylic layovers there.
        I like it so much that i had my honeymoon there too. The traffic can be horendous
        but its easy to get around on foot or by the electric train. Places i like visiting
        include the markets Klong Thom, Sampeng, Bobay etc. I'm not much of a night
        scene person but Khaosan road and Patpong are there for those that like that
        kind of revelry</p>
